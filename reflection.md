## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

1. The survey titles were impressively descriptive, but I realized they were also unnecessarily long, making them a bit challenging to manage during the analysis process. For instance, the question "What is your annual salary? (You'll indicate the currency in a later question. If you are part-time or hourly, please enter an annualized equivalent -- what you would earn if you worked the job 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.)" could have been renamed to something like "annual_salary" right from the beginning. This would have saved so much time and made the entire workflow feel more elegant and streamlined.

2. I found Streamlit's `scatter_chart` feature to be extremely user-friendly and effective for visualizing data quickly.

3. While working with S3 uploads, I noticed that it seems like all users are uploading to the same destination. This raised a question: Is there a way to differentiate uploads by user or another attribute to organize them better?

4. I experimented with using Ruff for code formatting and was impressed by its efficiency and ease of use. It streamlined my workflow significantly.
